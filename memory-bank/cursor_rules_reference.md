# Development Rules Reference

This project follows the development standards and workflows defined in the Cursor settings. These include:

- Code quality standards (TypeScript, functional programming, testing)
- GitHub workflow (issues, branches, PRs)
- Versioning guidelines (when to bump versions)
- GitHub CLI usage (with temporary files for formatted content)

Refer to the Cursor settings for the full development standards and workflow guidelines.

## Key Project-Specific Notes

- Documentation-only changes (like fixing URLs or typos) don't require version bumps
- Use temporary markdown files for GitHub CLI commands with formatted content
- Version numbers follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Consider security implications when handling user data
- All new features should have corresponding tests
- Keep CHANGELOG.md updated with all changes under appropriate sections
