# Progress

## What Works
- Core conversion functionality for Markdown to Tana format
- Three main command workflows:
  - Quick clipboard conversion (no UI)
  - Paste and edit interface
  - Convert selected text
- All basic Markdown elements:
  - Headings (H1-H6)
  - Bullet lists (`-`, `*`, `+`)
  - Numbered lists
  - Paragraphs
  - Nested content
- Field detection and conversion
- Python script alternative for large files
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure

## Recent Additions
- YouTube transcript timestamp support
- Improved formatting preservation
- Corrected indentation hierarchy
- Enhanced error handling

## What's Left to Build
- Features in development:
  - Support for more complex Markdown structures
  - Additional formatting options
  - Performance optimizations
- Potential future enhancements:
  - Support for tables
  - Enhanced code block handling
  - Additional special format conversions

## Current Status
- Version 1.2.0 released (stable)
- Unreleased changes in development
- Core functionality complete and tested
- Python script implementation stable
- Documentation complete

## Known Issues
- Potential edge cases with complex nested structures
- Special formatting that may not convert correctly
- Performance considerations with very large documents
- Need for continued refinement of conversion rules

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests in place for core conversion logic
- Manual testing conducted for complex scenarios
- Jest testing framework implemented
- Additional test cases being developed for edge cases
