# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Memory bank creation and setup
- Understanding the project structure and requirements
- Identifying key components and their relationships

## Recent Changes
- Version 1.2.0 (2025-04-03):
  - Added support for YouTube transcript timestamps as separate nodes
  - Added comprehensive Jest testing infrastructure
  - Fixed text formatting preservation (bold formatting)

## Active Decisions
- Memory bank structure established to document project context
- Documentation approach focusing on modular components
- Dual implementation strategy (Raycast + Python) maintained for different use cases

## Next Steps
- Review core conversion logic in `tana-converter.ts` to understand implementation details
- Examine test coverage and identify any gaps
- Explore potential new features from unreleased changes
- Identify opportunities for improvement in the conversion process
- Consider how to handle more complex Markdown structures

## Current Challenges
- Understanding the specific requirements of Tana's format
- Tracking edge cases in the conversion process
- Balancing performance with comprehensive conversion capabilities
- Managing the dual implementation approach (TypeScript and Python)

## Open Questions
- What are the most common error cases in the conversion process?
- Are there any Markdown elements not currently supported?
- How does the system handle very large documents?
- What improvements could be made to the current implementation?
